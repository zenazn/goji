/*
Package bind provides a convenient way to bind to sockets. It exposes a flag in
the default flag set named "bind" which provides syntax to bind TCP and UNIX
sockets. It also supports binding to arbitrary file descriptors passed by a
parent (for instance, systemd), and for binding to Einhorn sockets (including
Einhorn ACK support).

If the value passed to bind contains a colon, as in ":8000" or "127.0.0.1:9001",
it will be treated as a TCP address. If it begins with a "/" or a ".", it will
be treated as a path to a UNIX socket. If it begins with the string "fd@", as in
"fd@3", it will be treated as a file descriptor (useful for use with systemd,
for instance). If it begins with the string "einhorn@", as in "einhorn@0", the
corresponding einhorn socket will be used.

If an option is not explicitly passed, the implementation will automatically
select between using "einhorn@0", "fd@3", and ":8000", depending on whether
Einhorn or systemd (or neither) is detected.

This package is a teensy bit magical, and goes out of its way to Do The Right
Thing in many situations, including in both development and production. If
you're looking for something less magical, you'd probably be better off just
calling net.Listen() the old-fashioned way.
