/*
Mux is an HTTP multiplexer, much like net/http's ServeMux. It functions as both
a middleware stack and as an HTTP router.

Middleware provide a great abstraction for actions that must be performed on
every request, such as request logging and authentication. To append, insert,
and remove middleware, you can call the Use, Insert, and Abandon functions
respectively.

Routes may be added using any of the HTTP verb functions (Get, Post, etc.), or
through the generic Handle function. Goji's routing algorithm is very simple:
routes are processed in the order they are added, and the first matching route
will be executed. Routes match if their HTTP method and Pattern both match.

/*
Router is a middleware that performs routing and stores the resulting Match in
Goji's environment. If a routing Match is present at the end of the middleware
stack, that Match is used instead of re-routing.

This middleware is especially useful to create post-routing middleware, e.g. a
request logger which prints which pattern or handler was selected, or an
authentication middleware which only applies to certain routes.

If you use nested Muxes with explicit routing, you should be aware that the
explicit routing information set by an outer Mux can be picked up by an inner
Mux, inadvertently causing an infinite routing loop. If you use both explicit
routing and nested Muxes, you should be sure to unset MatchKey before the inner
Mux performs routing (or attach a Router to the inner Mux as well).

Handle dispatches to the given handler when the pattern matches, regardless of
HTTP method.

This method is commonly used to implement sub-routing: an admin application, for
instance, can expose a single handler that is attached to the main Mux by
calling Handle("/admin/*", adminHandler) or similar. Note that this function
doesn't strip this prefix from the path before forwarding it on (e.g., the
handler will see the full path, including the "/admin/" part), but this
functionality can easily be performed by an extra middleware layer.
